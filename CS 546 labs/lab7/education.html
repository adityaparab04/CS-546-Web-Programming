            <p>Favourite class in this school is Web Programming. I want to become a full stack developer and this course is helping me alot. Professor Hill is an excellent professor whatever he teaches it's very easier to understand. His assignments are quiet tough which helps us learn more and more in this course. TA's for this class are really helpful. They help us during their office hours with errors in our assignment code. The course has a weekly quiz which is quiet simple and helps us understand basics. It's the most challenging and useful course I have taken this semester.</p>

                Favourite class in this school was Data Structures and Algorithms. I love solving coding problems and this is where my journey started in coding. I started practising DSA problems, professor helped me if I had any problems regarding my code or errors. There were times when I almost quit coding but the motivation which I got was from my professor. Thus this course
